    <h1>Rachel’s “Traditional” English-Trifle</h1>
    <p>Season 6 gave us one of Friends’ most iconic food moments ever – Rachel’s attempt at making Thanksgiving dessert gone horribly wrong. In “The One Where Ross Got High,” Rachel volunteers to make a traditional English trifle, but when the pages of her cookbook stick together, she accidentally makes half of a trifle and half of a shepherd’s pie.</p>

    <p>The shredded coconut in here is meant to represent the ground beef in a shepherd’s pie—should you accidentally combine two different Thanksgiving recipes into one! Don’t worry, your friends will love this dessert and no one will complain that it tastes like feet.</p>
