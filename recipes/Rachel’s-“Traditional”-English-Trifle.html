    <h1>Rachel’s “Traditional” English-Trifle</h1>
    <p>Season 6 gave us one of Friends’ most iconic food moments ever – Rachel’s attempt at making Thanksgiving dessert gone horribly wrong. In “The One Where Ross Got High,” Rachel volunteers to make a traditional English trifle, but when the pages of her cookbook stick together, she accidentally makes half of a trifle and half of a shepherd’s pie.</p>

    <p>The shredded coconut in here is meant to represent the ground beef in a shepherd’s pie—should you accidentally combine two different Thanksgiving recipes into one! Don’t worry, your friends will love this dessert and no one will complain that it tastes like feet.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><strong>Yields: 4 to 6 servings • Prep time: 25 minutes • Chill time: 1 to 8 hours<strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>1 cup heavy whipping cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 cups instant vanilla pudding (half of a 3.4-ounce box)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1½ cups unsweetened shredded coconut</strong></li>
        <li><strong>6 tablespoons chocolate hazelnut spread</strong></li>
        <li><strong>24 ounces pound cake, cut into ½-inch cubes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ cup seedless raspberry jam</strong></li>
        <li><strong>24 ounces fresh raspberries, washed and dried</strong></li>
        <li><strong>fresh mint springs (optional)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3><strong>To make the trifle:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Into the bowl of a stand mixer set to high speed, or using a hand mixer, pour the heavy cream. Mix on high speed until soft peaks form, 6 to 7 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator while you continue making the trifle.</p></li>
        <li><p>Prepare the instant vanilla pudding according to package instructions. Refrigerate while you continue with the recipe.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a small mixing bowl, stir the coconut and chocolate hazelnut spread to combine. Set aside.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong>To Assemble trifle</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place about half of the pound cake in a 7½-inch glass trifle dish or a large glass bowl. Spoon about half of the raspberry jam on top of the pound cake and spread using an offset spatula or butter knife.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spoon half of the vanilla pudding on top of the jam, then top with a layer of the coconut and chocolate hazelnut mixture. Spoon about half of the whipped cream on top of the coconut and chocolate hazelnut. Top this layer with half of the fresh raspberries.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat with the remaining ingredients, to the brim of the dish.</p></li>
        <li><p>Let chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Top with fresh mint sprigs, if desired, right before serving</p></li>
    </ol>
