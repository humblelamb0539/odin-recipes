    <h1>Floor Cheesecake</h1>
    <p>While no one wanted to eat Rachel’s trifle, Rachel and Chandler couldn’t get enough of Mama’s Little Bakery cheesecakes. In the aptly named “The One With All the Cheesecakes” from season 7, Rachel and Chandler become obsessed with a cheesecake accidentally delivered to his door. So obsessed that they then steal another one from in front of their neighbor Mrs. Braverman’s door and eventually resort to eating it off the floor.</p>

    <p>This cheesecake is so good, you’ll be willing to cheat, lie, or steal for it. Just as long as you don’t resort to eating it off the floor…. Ideas for cheesecake toppings are caramel, chocolate or berry sauce, and whipped cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><strong>Yields: 8 to 12 servings • Prep time: 10 minutes • Cook time: 68 minutes • Chill time: 8 hours<strong></h3>
    <h3><strong>For graham cracker crust</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1½ cups graham cracker crumbs (about 9 sheets of graham crackers)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</strong></li>
        <li><strong>¼ cup granulated sugar</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>For the cheesecake</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4 (8-ounce) blocks full-fat cream cheese, softened</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 cup full-fat sour cream, room temperature</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</strong></li>
        <li><strong>juice of 1 small lemon</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 large eggs, room temperature</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the graham cracker crumbs into a medium mixing bowl, add the melted butter and ¼ cup sugar, and stir to combine with a rubber spatula. Press the graham cracker crust mixture into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared springform pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Prebake the crust for 8 minutes, remove from the oven, and place on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Allow to cool slightly.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the bowl of a stand mixer set to medium speed or using a hand mixer, cream together the cream cheese and sugar until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice, and mix until thoroughly combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix well after each addition but be mindful not to overmix.</p></li>
        <li><p>To make a water bath, boil a medium pot of water. While the water is boiling, wrap the aluminum foil around the sides of the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the graham cracker crust, using a rubber spatula to spread the mixture evenly.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the springform pan inside a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the boiled water about an inch up the sides of the roasting pan. Place in the oven and bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until the center of the cheesecake is nearly set. Remove from oven and set aside while you make the frosting.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a small mixing bowl, whisk the sour cream, remaining sugar, and vanilla until well blended; carefully spread over cheesecake. Bake cheesecake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the frosting has set.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn the oven off, but leave the cheesecake inside and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake cool down inside the oven for 1 hour. Remove and let cool at room temperature.</p></li>
        <li><p>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours before slicing and serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
