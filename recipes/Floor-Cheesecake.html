    <h1>Floor Cheesecake</h1>
    <p>While no one wanted to eat Rachel’s trifle, Rachel and Chandler couldn’t get enough of Mama’s Little Bakery cheesecakes. In the aptly named “The One With All the Cheesecakes” from season 7, Rachel and Chandler become obsessed with a cheesecake accidentally delivered to his door. So obsessed that they then steal another one from in front of their neighbor Mrs. Braverman’s door and eventually resort to eating it off the floor.</p>
    <p>This cheesecake is so good, you’ll be willing to cheat, lie, or steal for it. Just as long as you don’t resort to eating it off the floor…. Ideas for cheesecake toppings are caramel, chocolate or berry sauce, and whipped cream.</p>
